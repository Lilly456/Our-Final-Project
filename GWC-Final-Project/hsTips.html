  <ul>
    <p>
    <img scr="hsTipsPic.jpg" alt="img"
    style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Check out your school's website</li></div>
      <div>Before school starts, check out your school's website. There's bound to be useful stuff, such as a bell schedule</div>
      <div>and school map. These will be extremely helpful those first couple of weeks of a new grade level.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Buy a sturdy long lasting school bag</li></div>
      <div>Chances are you'll be carrying around more than just binders and folders (i. e. library books, items for school</div>
      <div>projects, etc.). Get an actual backpack, not just a large purse or book bag. These will wear on your shoulder</div>
      <div> and neck muscles if your purse or book bag weighs more than 3 lbs. I recommend getting a backpack with </div>
      <div>padded shoulder straps (no string bags!) and even a padded back, if you can find it.  </div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Be on time to class and always listen and pay attention</li></div>
      <div>This is a really simple task, but be on time. If you rack up tardies, you'll have consequences such as lunch</div>
      <div>detention, after-school "tardy party", calls home, etc. It's a pain to deal with those things and it ticks off </div>
      <div>your teachers, so just get to class on time.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Use a planner</li></div>
      <div>Before school starts for the year, grab a planner at a local school supply store. Make sure it's small, but has</div>
      <div>enough room for you to write more than one assignment per subject. A planner will help you remember test dates <div>
      <div>and what's due for what class and when after a long break. Also, write down any after-school things like club <div>
      <div>meetings and practices, and make sure to include start and end times.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Do your study guides</li></div>
      <div>Study guides are called study guides for a reason. Do them, and you'll feel more prepared for upcoming tests, </div>
      <div>and depending on your teacher, the study guide may have some questions that show up on that test. Keep your </div>
      <div>study guides after major unit tests to use for review before you start midterms, end-of-course state tests,
      <div> and/or finals. </div>

<div class="header1">Healthy Work and Study Habits</div>
  <ul>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Don't attempt to cram all your studying into one session</li></div>
      <div>Ever find yourself up late at night expending more energy trying to keep your eyelids open than you are </div>
      <div>studying? If so, it's time for a change. Successful students typically space their work out over shorter </div>
      <div>periods of time and rarely try to cram all of their studying into just one or two sessions. If you want to </div>
      <div>become a successful student then you need to learn to be consistent in your studies and to have regular, yet</div>
      <div> shorter, study periods.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Plan when you're going to study</li></div>
      <div>Successful students schedule specific times throughout the week when they are going to study -- and then they</div>
      <div>stick with their schedule. Students who study sporadically and whimsically typically do not perform as well as</div>
      <div>students who have a set study schedule. Even if you're all caught up with your studies, creating a weekly </div>
      <div>routine, where you set aside a period of time a few days a week, to review your courses will ensure you develop </div>
      <div>habits that will enable you to succeed in your education long term.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Study at the same time</li></div>
      <div>Not only is it important that you plan when you're going to study, it's important you create a consistent, daily</div>
      <div>study routine. When you study at the same time each day and each week, you're studying will become a regular part</div>
      <div>of your life. You'll be mentally and emotionally more prepared for each study session and each study session will </div>
      <div>become more productive. If you have to change your schedule from time to time due to unexpected events, that's okay,</div>
      <div>but get back on your routine as soon as the event has passed.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Each stydy time should have a specific goal</li></div>
      <div>Simply studying without direction is not effective. You need to know exactly what you need to accomplish during each</div>
      <div>study session. Before you start studying, set a study session goal that supports your overall academic goal </div>
      <div>(i.e. memorize 30 vocabulary words in order to ace the vocabulary section on an upcoming Spanish test.)</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Never procrastinate your planned study session</li></div>
      <div>It's very easy, and common, to put off your study session because of lack of interest in the subject, because you </div>
      <div>have other things you need to get done, or just because the assignment is hard. Successful students DO NOT procrastinate</div>
      <div>studying. If you procrastinate your study session, your studying will become much less effective and you may not get </div>
      <div>everything accomplished that you need to. Procrastination also leads to rushing, and rushing is the number one cause </div>
      <div>of errors.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Start with the most difficult subject first</li></div>
      <div>As your most difficult assignment or subject will require the most effort and mental energy, you should start with it</div>
      <div>first. Once you've completed the most difficult work, it will be much easier to complete the rest of your work. Believe</div>
      <div> it or not, starting with the most difficult subject will greatly improve the effectiveness of your study sessions, and</div>
      <div> your academic performance.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Always review your notes before starting an assignment</li></div>
      <div>Obviously, before you can review your notes you must first have notes to review. Always make sure to take good notes in</div>
      <div> class. Before you start each study session, and before you start a particular assignment, review your notes thoroughly</div>
      <div> to make sure you know how to complete the assignment correctly. Reviewing your notes before each study session will help</div>
      <div>you remember important subject matter learned during the day, and make sure your studying is targeted and effective.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Make sure you're not distracted while studying</li></div>
      <div>Everyone gets distracted by something. Maybe it's the TV. Or maybe it's your family. Or maybe it's just too quite. Some </div>
      <div>people actually study better with a little background noise. When you're distracted while studying you (1) lose your train</div>
      <div> of thought and (2) are unable to focus -- both of which will lead to very ineffective studying. Before you start studying</div>
      <div> find a place where you won't be disturbed or distracted. For some people this is a quiet cubical in the recesses of the </div>
      <div>library. For others is in a common area where there is a little background noise.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Use study groups effectively</li></div>
      <div>Ever heard the phrase "two heads are better than one?" Well this can be especially true when it comes to studying. Working </div>
      <div>in groups enables you to (1) get help from others when you're struggling to understand a concept, (2) complete assignments </div>
      <div>more quickly, and (3) teach others, whereby helping both the other students and yourself to internalize the subject matter. </div>
      <div>However, study groups can become very ineffective if they're not structured and if groups members come unprepared. Effective </div>
      <div>students use study groups effectively.</div>
    <div class="bullet1"><li>Review your notes, schoolwork and other class materials over the weekend</li></div>
      <div>Successful students review what they've learned during the week over the weekend. This way they're well prepared to continue<div>
      <div> learning new concepts that build upon previous coursework and knowledge acquired the previous week.</div>
<div>We're confident that if you'll develop the habits outlined above that you'll see a major improvement in your academic success.</div>

  <div class="header1">Balencing Friends and School Life</div>
    <ul>
      <div class="bullet1"><li>Keep an updated schedule</li></div>
        <div>This is a great way to make use of the calendar app on your phone. Take the time to add your class schedule for</div>
        <div> the semester as well as any due dates for your assignments. Set aside specific times throughout the week to focus</div>
        <div> on things like homework, laundry, and the gym. If you work in retail and have a schedule that moves around each </div>
        <div>week, it can be difficult to stay consistent with plans. If this is the case, try to design your schedule when you </div>
        <div>find out your work hours each week.</div>
      <div class="bullet1"><li>Work ahead (Don't procrastinate)</li></div>
        <div>By procrastinating you are allowing your to-do list to grow and grow into an intimidating amount of work. Once all </div>
        <div>that work has piled up, it will be even harder to motivate yourself to get started. Getting ahead on readings, </div>
        <div>papers, and other assignments will help reduce procrastination-based stress while allowing more time in the future</div>
        <div> for hanging out with friends or just relaxing with a weekend of Netflix binging. Resources like Course Hero—which </div>
        <div>offers study resources, online tutoring, and digital flashcards—can help you study ahead and compare notes to past</div>
        <div> students who’ve taken your exact courses before.</div>
      <div class="bullet1"><li>Get a goodnight's sleep</li></div>
        <div>We regularly hear about the benefits of getting more sleep, from maintaining a strong immune system to improving our </div>
        <div>moods, but we seldom manage to actually implement this advice. Sometimes we get so entrenched in our work that the </div>
        <div>high amount of stress and large workload can keep us from getting enough sleep. If you really take the time to improve</div>
        <div> the quality of your sleep,your stress levels will go down and you’ll be able to think more clearly and make fewer</div>
        <div> mistakes in your work.</div>
      <div class="bullet1"><li>Prioritize your work</li></div>
        <div>Organize your work in a meaningful way based on when projects, papers, and other work events are due. Recurring things</div>
        <div> like homework and studying are easier to schedule ahead of time, but sometimes papers and projects tend to sneak up</div>
        <div> on you. Make sure to check your syllabus to see how different assignments are weighted. Important assignments like</div>
        <div> papers and exams can make the difference of a full letter grade (or two!) for a class. Prioritizing assignments will</div>
        <div> allow you to focus on what is most important first, and then knock out smaller assignments afterward. Knowing you’ve</div>
        <div> completed a major project and don’t have to worry about it hanging over your head can also help you to feel more</div>
        <div> balanced and relaxed.</div>
      <div class="bullet1"><li>Make time for yourself</li></div>
        <div>Whether this means spending time with friends, visiting family, or even just taking a moment to relax by yourself,</div>
        <div> it is important for your well-being to have some time set aside away from work and school. Once you have finished </div>
        <div>important tasks, be sure to find some way to treat yourself and clear your head.

Following this simple advice might not melt all your stress away, but it will help you stay sane while still maintaining a busy schedule. And remember, you don’t have to go through it all alone! Be sure to take advantage of all the resources at your disposal, including Course Hero’s homework help and study resources.</div>
